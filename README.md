# autologin
Python script to complete the "360 days login" achievement

As you might know some trackers have a "360 days non-stop login" challenge but nobody have such time/discipline to login a site for a year straight. That's why I came up with this script.
Just change the following variables values and schedule it in a cron/scheduled task:
- "site_path"
- "username"
- "password"

Make sure you have "BeautifulSoup4" and "requests" installed
- pip install BeautifulSoup4
- pip install requests
